accounts. Fixed-term deposits require a minimum of GBP 1,000.

2.3 Junior savings accounts may be opened by a parent or legal guardian for
children under 16.

## 3. Interest Rates

3.1 The annual interest rate on the Instant Access Saver is variable and
currently set at 3.2% AER. Interest is calculated daily and paid monthly.

deducted at source.
