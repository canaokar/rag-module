# Revised Capital Buffer Requirements Under Basel III.1

The Prudential Regulation Authority has published revised capital buffer requirements as part of the UK implementation of the Basel III.1 framework. These changes affect all PRA-regulated banks and building societies.

## Countercyclical Capital Buffer

The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate for UK exposures has been set at 2% of risk-weighted assets, effective from the date noted above. This represents an increase from the previous rate of 1% and reflects the PRA's assessment of systemic risk in the current economic environment.

## Capital Conservation Buffer

The capital conservation buffer remains at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. However, the PRA has introduced new restrictions on distributions when a firm's capital ratio falls within the buffer range. Firms within the buffer range must submit a capital restoration plan within 30 days.

## Systemic Risk Buffer

The systemic risk buffer for ring-fenced bodies has been recalibrated. Firms with total assets exceeding 175 billion GBP must maintain a systemic risk buffer of at least 3%. Firms with total assets between 100 billion and 175 billion GBP must maintain a buffer of at least 2%.

## Output Floor

The Basel III.1 output floor has been introduced at 72.5% of standardised risk-weighted assets. This sets a minimum level for risk-weighted assets calculated using internal models, preventing excessive divergence from the standardised approach.

## Transitional Arrangements

The output floor will be phased in over five years, starting at 50% in 2025 and increasing by 5 percentage points annually until reaching the final level of 72.5% in 2030. Firms must report their output floor calculations quarterly.

## Impact Assessment

Firms must submit an impact assessment to the PRA within 90 days of the effective date, detailing how the revised requirements affect their capital position and any planned remediation measures.
