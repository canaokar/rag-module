# Updated Transaction Monitoring Thresholds

The Financial Conduct Authority has revised the transaction monitoring thresholds applicable to all regulated firms. These changes reflect the increased sophistication of money laundering techniques and the need for more granular detection capabilities.

## Revised Thresholds

The threshold for automatic suspicious transaction reporting has been lowered from 15,000 GBP to 10,000 GBP for single transactions. For structured transactions, the aggregate threshold over a rolling 7-day period has been reduced from 25,000 GBP to 15,000 GBP.

Cross-border wire transfers now require enhanced scrutiny for any amount exceeding 3,000 GBP, down from the previous 5,000 GBP threshold. This aligns with updated FATF recommendations on wire transfer monitoring.

## Real-Time Monitoring Requirements

Firms with annual transaction volumes exceeding 1 billion GBP must implement real-time transaction monitoring systems by the compliance deadline. Smaller firms may continue with batch processing but must ensure reviews are completed within 24 hours of transaction execution.

## Behavioural Analytics

The FCA now recommends that firms incorporate behavioural analytics into their transaction monitoring frameworks. This includes monitoring for unusual patterns such as rapid movement of funds across multiple accounts, transactions inconsistent with customer profiles, and sudden changes in transaction frequency or value.

## Compliance Timeline

Firms have 180 days from the effective date to update their monitoring systems to reflect the new thresholds. The FCA expects firms to submit a compliance implementation plan within 60 days of the effective date.

## Penalties

Failure to update monitoring thresholds within the compliance timeline may result in enforcement action, including financial penalties and public censure.
