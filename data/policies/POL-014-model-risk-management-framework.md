# Model Risk Management Framework

## 1. Framework Scope

This framework governs the development, validation, implementation, and
ongoing monitoring of quantitative models used across the Bank, including
credit scoring, market risk, and operational risk models. It aligns with
PRA SS3/18 and ECB guidance on internal models.

## 2. Model Development

2.1 All new models must be developed in accordance with the Bank's Model
Development Standards and approved by the Model Risk Committee.

2.2 Development documentation must include: model purpose, methodology, data
sources, assumptions, limitations, and performance benchmarks.

2.3 Models must be developed in a controlled environment with version control,
audit trails, and segregation between development and production environments.

## 3. Independent Validation

3.1 All models must undergo independent validation before deployment.
Validation must be performed by a team separate from development.

3.2 Material models must be revalidated at least annually or when performance
deteriorates beyond the threshold of 8.0%.

3.3 Validation reports must include: an assessment of conceptual soundness,
data quality analysis, backtesting results, benchmarking against alternative
approaches, and a clear recommendation.

## 4. Model Inventory

4.1 A central model inventory must be maintained, recording model owner,
validation status, materiality tier, and next review date.

4.2 The inventory must classify models into three materiality tiers:

- Tier 1 (High): Models used for regulatory capital calculation, IFRS 9
  provisioning, or stress testing
- Tier 2 (Medium): Models used for pricing, risk management, or strategic
  decision-making
- Tier 3 (Low): Models used for operational processes or management
  information

## 5. Model Performance Monitoring

5.1 All Tier 1 and Tier 2 models must be subject to ongoing performance
monitoring, including backtesting, stability analysis, and benchmarking.

5.2 Performance monitoring results must be reported to the Model Risk
Committee quarterly.

5.3 A model must be taken out of production or restricted in use if
performance monitoring reveals material degradation that cannot be remediated
within 30 business days.

## 6. Governance and Oversight

The Model Risk Committee meets quarterly and is chaired by the Chief Risk
Officer. It is responsible for approving new models, reviewing validation
findings, and overseeing the model inventory.

## 7. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a material
model failure or regulatory finding. The review must be documented and signed
off by the Chief Risk Officer.

## 8. Definitions

"Model" means a quantitative method, system, or approach that applies
statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and
assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates (as per PRA
SS3/18).

"Material Model" means any model classified as Tier 1 or Tier 2 in the
Bank's model inventory.
