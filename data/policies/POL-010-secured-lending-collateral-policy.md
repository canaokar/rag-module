3.3 Re-valuations are required at the following intervals: residential
property -- every 3 years; commercial property -- annually; listed securities

obtained and the lower value used for LTV calculation.

## 4. Haircuts

  policy)
- Commercial property: 10-30% depending on property type and location
- Listed securities: 25% for equities, 10% for investment-grade bonds
- Cash deposits: 0%
- Government bonds: 5%

4.2 Haircuts must be reviewed annually by the Credit Risk function and

exposures and quarterly for retail exposures.

6.2 Where collateral coverage falls below the minimum required level, the
Bank must request additional collateral or partial repayment within 10
business days.

## 7. Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for the matters covered
by this document. Day-to-day oversight is delegated to the Credit Risk function.
