# Whistleblowing Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

The Bank is committed to maintaining an open culture where employees and
stakeholders can raise concerns about wrongdoing without fear of retaliation.
This policy complies with the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 and the
FCA's requirements for whistleblowing arrangements.

## 2. Scope

2.1 This policy applies to all employees, contractors, temporary workers,
secondees, and any person providing services to the Bank.

2.2 Concerns may relate to: criminal activity, failure to comply with legal
or regulatory obligations, miscarriages of justice, danger to health and
safety, damage to the environment, deliberate concealment of information
relating to any of the above.

## 3. Reporting Channels

3.1 Concerns may be raised through the confidential whistleblowing hotline,
the online reporting portal, or directly with the Whistleblowing Champion.

3.2 Anonymous reports will be accepted and investigated to the extent possible
given the information provided.

3.3 The FCA and PRA also operate external whistleblowing channels. Employees
may report directly to the regulator at any time.

## 4. Investigation Process

4.1 An initial assessment must be completed within 7 business days of receipt.
The reporter must be notified of the outcome within 45 business days.

4.2 Investigations must be conducted by individuals independent of the area
under investigation.

4.3 The investigation must be documented, including: the allegation, evidence
reviewed, individuals interviewed, findings, and recommended actions.

4.4 The Whistleblowing Champion must approve the investigation plan and
receive regular progress updates.

## 5. Protections for Reporters

5.1 The Bank prohibits any form of retaliation, victimisation, or detrimental
treatment against a person who raises a concern in good faith.

5.2 Any individual found to have retaliated against a whistleblower will be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.

5.3 The identity of the reporter will be kept confidential to the extent
possible, consistent with the need to conduct a fair investigation.

## 6. Record Keeping

6.1 All whistleblowing reports and investigation records must be retained for
a minimum of 7 years.

6.2 Aggregate data on whistleblowing reports (anonymised) must be reported to
the Board Audit Committee at least annually.

## 7. Training

7.1 All staff must receive whistleblowing awareness training as part of their
induction and at least every two years thereafter.

7.2 Managers must receive additional training on how to handle concerns raised
by their teams.

## 8. Governance and Oversight

The Whistleblowing Champion is a non-executive director appointed by the
Board. The Champion has a direct reporting line to the Board and is
responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of the Bank's whistleblowing
arrangements.

The FCA requires the Bank to notify it if a whistleblowing disclosure is
made that relates to regulatory concerns.

## 9. Review and Amendment

This policy must be reviewed at least annually or following a material
whistleblowing event. The review must be documented and signed off by the
Whistleblowing Champion.

## 10. Related Documents

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, the Disciplinary Procedure, and the
Grievance Procedure.
