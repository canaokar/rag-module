# Revised Complaint Handling Timeframes

The Financial Conduct Authority has revised the timeframes and procedural requirements for complaint handling by regulated firms. These changes are designed to improve customer outcomes and reduce the time customers wait for resolution.

## Acknowledgement Requirements

Firms must acknowledge receipt of a complaint within one business day, reduced from the previous requirement of three business days. The acknowledgement must include a unique complaint reference number, the name and contact details of the assigned complaint handler, and an expected resolution timeline.

## Resolution Timeframes

Simple complaints must be resolved within 15 business days, reduced from the previous 20-day standard. Complex complaints involving multiple products or third parties must be resolved within 35 business days, reduced from 56 days.

If a complaint cannot be resolved within the applicable timeframe, the firm must send the customer a written update explaining the reason for the delay, the steps being taken to resolve the complaint, and a revised expected completion date. Updates must be sent at least every 10 business days until the complaint is resolved.

## Escalation Requirements

Customers must be informed of their right to escalate to the Financial Ombudsman Service at the point of acknowledgement and again if the complaint is not resolved within the applicable timeframe. The escalation information must include clear instructions and the relevant contact details.

## Root Cause Analysis

Firms must conduct root cause analysis for all complaints on a quarterly basis. Where patterns are identified, firms must implement systemic remediation within 60 days and report the outcomes to their board or governing body.

## Reporting

Firms must submit complaint data to the FCA on a semi-annual basis, including volumes by category, average resolution times, outcomes, and compensation paid. The first report under the revised framework is due six months after the effective date.
