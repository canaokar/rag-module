# Cross-Border Data Transfer Standard

## 1. Scope and Legal Basis

This standard sets out the requirements for transferring personal data outside
the United Kingdom in compliance with the UK GDPR. It applies to all business
units, subsidiaries, and third parties processing personal data on behalf of
the Bank.

## 2. Transfer Mechanisms

2.1 Personal data may only be transferred to a country outside the UK where
one of the following safeguards is in place:

- The destination country has received an adequacy decision from the UK
  Secretary of State
- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the ICO are in place
- Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) have been approved by the relevant
  supervisory authority
- An explicit derogation under Article 49 UK GDPR applies (used only in
  exceptional circumstances)

2.2 The use of derogations must be approved by the DPO on a case-by-case
basis and documented in the Transfer Register.

## 3. Transfer Impact Assessments

3.1 A Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) must be completed for all transfers
to countries without an adequacy decision.

3.2 The TIA must evaluate: the legal framework in the destination country,
the recipient's ability to comply with the SCCs, any supplementary measures
required, and the nature and sensitivity of the data being transferred.

3.3 TIAs must be reviewed annually or when there is a material change in
the legal framework of the destination country.

## 4. Supplementary Measures

4.1 Where a TIA identifies that the transfer mechanism alone does not provide
an essentially equivalent level of protection, supplementary measures must
be implemented. These may include:

- Technical measures: encryption in transit and at rest, pseudonymisation,
  split processing
- Organisational measures: access controls, security certifications,
  contractual commitments to challenge disproportionate access requests
- Contractual measures: enhanced audit rights, notification obligations

## 5. Transfer Register

5.1 The Bank must maintain a register of all cross-border data transfers,
including: data categories, destination country, transfer mechanism, date of
TIA, and responsible data owner.

5.2 The Transfer Register must be updated within 10 business days of any new
transfer or material change.

## 6. Intra-Group Transfers

6.1 Transfers between Bank subsidiaries in different jurisdictions must comply
with the same requirements as transfers to external parties unless Binding
Corporate Rules are in place.

6.2 The Bank's BCR application covers transfers to subsidiaries in the
following jurisdictions: India, Singapore, and the United States.

## 7. Governance and Oversight

The DPO is responsible for monitoring compliance with this standard. The
DPO must report to the Board Audit Committee on cross-border transfer
activity at least annually.

## 8. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a material
change in the legal framework for international data transfers.

## 9. Related Documents

This standard should be read in conjunction with the Data Protection Policy,
the Third-Party Risk Management Policy, and the Information Security Policy.
