# Enhanced Customer Due Diligence Requirements for High-Risk Jurisdictions

The Financial Conduct Authority has issued an amendment to the existing Customer Due Diligence (CDD) framework, introducing enhanced requirements for customers and transactions linked to high-risk jurisdictions. This update supersedes the previous guidance issued in 2022.

## Key Changes

Firms must now apply Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) measures for all customers who are residents of, or have significant business connections to, jurisdictions identified on the FCA High-Risk Third Countries list. The revised list now includes 14 additional jurisdictions following the latest FATF mutual evaluations.

## New Requirements

All new customer relationships involving high-risk jurisdictions must undergo senior management approval before onboarding. The approval must be documented and retained for a minimum of seven years. Existing customers with high-risk jurisdiction connections must be reviewed within 90 days of this update taking effect.

Transaction monitoring thresholds for high-risk jurisdiction customers have been reduced. Any single transaction exceeding 5,000 GBP or aggregate transactions exceeding 10,000 GBP within a 30-day period must be flagged for manual review.

## Source of Funds Requirements

Firms must obtain and verify source of funds documentation for all high-risk jurisdiction customers, regardless of transaction value. Acceptable documentation includes audited financial statements, tax returns from the relevant jurisdiction, and bank statements covering at least 12 months.

## Reporting Obligations

Firms must submit quarterly reports to the FCA detailing the number of high-risk jurisdiction customers, total transaction volumes, and any suspicious activity reports filed. The first report is due within 60 days of the effective date.
