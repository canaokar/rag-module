# Conduct Risk Management Policy

## 1. Policy Objective

This policy sets out the Bank's expectations for conduct risk management,
ensuring that the Bank delivers fair outcomes for customers, maintains market
integrity, and promotes effective competition. It aligns with the FCA's
Consumer Duty and the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR).

## 2. Conduct Standards

2.1 All staff must act with integrity, due skill, care, and diligence in
accordance with the FCA's Conduct Rules.

2.2 Product design must consider the needs and characteristics of the target
market and potential for customer harm.

2.3 Remuneration structures must not incentivise behaviours that could lead
to poor customer outcomes.

2.4 The Bank must ensure that customers receive communications that are clear,
fair, and not misleading.

## 3. Consumer Duty

3.1 The Bank must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers across
the following areas: products and services, price and value, consumer
understanding, and consumer support.

3.2 Target market assessments must be completed for all retail products and
reviewed at least annually.

3.3 Fair value assessments must demonstrate that the price paid by customers
is reasonable relative to the benefits received.

3.4 Vulnerable customer identification processes must be embedded in all
customer-facing operations.

## 4. Complaints Handling

resolved within 40 business days.

4.2 Trends in complaints must be analysed quarterly and reported to the
Conduct Risk Committee.

4.3 Root cause analysis must be conducted for any product or service that
generates complaint volumes exceeding the Bank's threshold of 0.5% of
active customers.

## 5. Conflicts of Interest

5.1 The Bank must maintain a Conflicts of Interest Register, updated
continuously.

5.2 All identified conflicts must be managed through appropriate controls
(avoidance, disclosure, or mitigation) and reviewed at least annually.

5.3 Staff must disclose any personal interests that could give rise to a
conflict, including directorships, shareholdings, and outside employment.

## 6. Market Conduct

6.1 The Bank must maintain effective arrangements to prevent market abuse,
including insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information, and
market manipulation.

6.2 A suspicious transaction and order report (STOR) must be submitted to
the FCA without delay where there is reasonable suspicion of market abuse.

6.3 Staff with access to inside information must be placed on an insider
list and reminded of their obligations under the Market Abuse Regulation.

## 7. Training

7.1 All staff must complete conduct risk and Consumer Duty training within
30 days of joining and annually thereafter.

7.2 Senior managers must complete enhanced training on their responsibilities
under SM&CR.

## 8. Governance and Oversight

The Conduct Risk Committee meets monthly and is chaired by the Chief
Compliance Officer. It reviews conduct metrics, complaints trends, and
Consumer Duty implementation progress.

## 9. Review and Amendment

This policy must be reviewed at least annually or following a material
regulatory change or conduct risk event.
