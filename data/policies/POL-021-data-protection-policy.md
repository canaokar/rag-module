# Data Protection Policy

## 1. Scope and Legal Basis

This policy sets out the Bank's obligations under the UK General Data
Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018. It applies
to all processing of personal data by or on behalf of the Bank.

The Bank acts as a data controller for customer and employee personal data
and as a data processor where it processes data on behalf of third parties
under contractual arrangements.

## 2. Data Processing Principles

2.1 Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently. A
valid lawful basis must be identified and documented before processing begins.

2.2 Data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes
and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.

2.3 Data minimisation: only personal data that is adequate, relevant, and
limited to what is necessary for the stated purpose may be collected.

2.4 Accuracy: personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up
to date. Inaccurate data must be rectified or erased without delay.

2.5 Storage limitation: personal data must not be kept for longer than is
necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. Retention periods are
defined in the Bank's Data Retention Schedule.

2.6 Integrity and confidentiality: personal data must be processed in a
manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against
unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction,
or damage.

## 3. Lawful Bases for Processing

3.1 The Bank relies on the following lawful bases for processing personal
data:

- Contract: processing necessary for the performance of a contract with the
  data subject (e.g., providing banking services)
- Legal obligation: processing necessary to comply with a legal obligation
  (e.g., AML regulations, tax reporting)
- Legitimate interests: processing necessary for the Bank's legitimate
  interests, where not overridden by the data subject's rights (e.g., fraud
  prevention, marketing)
- Consent: where the data subject has given clear consent (e.g., optional
  marketing communications)

## 4. Data Subject Rights

4.1 Subject Access Requests must be fulfilled within 25 business days of
receipt. The DPO must be consulted for complex or sensitive requests.

4.2 The right to erasure must be facilitated unless processing is required
for compliance with a legal obligation or the establishment, exercise, or
defence of legal claims.

4.3 The right to data portability applies where processing is based on
consent or contract and is carried out by automated means.

## 5. Data Breach Management

5.1 Any suspected personal data breach must be reported to the DPO within 1
business day of discovery.

5.2 Breaches likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of
individuals must be notified to the ICO within 72 hours.

5.3 Affected data subjects must be notified without undue delay where the
breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms.

5.4 All breaches, regardless of severity, must be recorded in the Data Breach
Register with details of the breach, its effects, and the remedial action
taken.

## 6. International Transfers

6.1 Personal data must not be transferred outside the UK unless adequate
safeguards are in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the
ICO or a binding adequacy decision.

6.2 All international transfers must be recorded in the Bank's Record of
Processing Activities (ROPA).

6.3 Transfer Impact Assessments must be conducted for transfers to countries
without an adequacy decision.

## 7. Data Protection Impact Assessments

7.1 A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be completed before
commencing any processing that is likely to result in a high risk to the
rights and freedoms of data subjects.

7.2 DPIAs must be reviewed and approved by the DPO before processing begins.

## 8. Governance and Oversight

The Data Protection Officer (DPO) is responsible for monitoring compliance
with this policy and with the UK GDPR. The DPO reports to the Board Audit
Committee at least semi-annually.

## 9. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a material data
protection incident or change in regulation. The review must be documented
and signed off by the DPO.
