# Credit Risk Appetite Statement

## 1. Purpose

This statement defines the level and types of credit risk the Bank is willing
to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives. It is approved by the Board
and provides the boundary conditions within which all credit decisions must
be made.

## 2. Overall Credit Risk Appetite

2.1 Total credit exposure must not exceed 8x the Bank's Common Equity Tier 1
capital.

2.2 Expected credit losses must not exceed 0.5% of the total lending book on
an annualised basis under the baseline economic scenario.

2.3 Unexpected credit losses under the severe stress scenario must not exceed
2.5% of the total lending book.

## 3. Concentration Limits

3.1 Single-name exposure must not exceed 10% of the Bank's total capital base,
or GBP 50,000,000, whichever is lower.

3.2 Sector concentration: no single industry sector may represent more than
15% of the total lending book.

3.3 Geographic concentration: UK domestic lending must represent at least 70%
of the total lending book. Non-UK exposure must not exceed 30%.

3.4 Product concentration: any single product type must not represent more than
40% of the total lending book.

## 4. Credit Quality Thresholds

4.1 At least 60% of the commercial lending book must be rated investment grade
(internal rating 1-4) or equivalent.

4.2 Sub-investment-grade exposures (internal rating 5-7) must not exceed 30%
of the commercial lending book.

4.3 Watchlist and non-performing exposures must not exceed 5% of the total
lending book at any time.

## 5. Monitoring and Escalation

5.1 Credit risk appetite metrics must be calculated and reported to the Board
Risk Committee monthly.

5.2 Amber trigger: any metric within 10% of its limit requires a remediation
plan within 15 business days.

5.3 Red breach: any metric exceeding its limit requires immediate escalation
to the Chief Risk Officer and a Board notification within 48 hours.

## 6. Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for setting and
monitoring credit risk appetite. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for
the day-to-day monitoring framework.

The Risk Appetite Statement must be reviewed and reapproved by the Board at
least annually, or more frequently if there is a material change in the
economic environment or the Bank's strategic direction.
