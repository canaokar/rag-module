# Third-Party Risk Management Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the framework for managing risks arising from the
Bank's reliance on third-party service providers, including outsourced
functions and cloud service providers. It aligns with EBA Guidelines on
Outsourcing Arrangements and PRA supervisory expectations.

## 2. Due Diligence

2.1 A risk assessment must be completed for all new third-party engagements
with an annual contract value exceeding GBP 100,000.

2.2 Critical and important outsourcing arrangements must be approved by the
Board or a delegated committee before execution.

2.3 Due diligence must cover: financial stability, information security
posture, business continuity capabilities, regulatory compliance, and
reputational risk.

## 3. Contractual Requirements

3.1 All outsourcing contracts must include: clearly defined service levels,
audit and access rights, data protection obligations, sub-outsourcing
controls, and termination provisions.

3.2 Contracts for critical functions must include the right for the Bank and
its regulators to access the third party's premises and data.

3.3 Service level agreements must specify measurable performance indicators,
remediation processes, and financial penalties for material non-performance.

## 4. Ongoing Monitoring

4.1 Service Level Agreements (SLAs) must be reviewed at least quarterly.
Persistent SLA breaches must be escalated to the Chief Operating Officer.

4.2 An annual on-site or virtual assessment must be conducted for all
critical third parties.

4.3 Concentration risk arising from reliance on a single provider for
multiple services must be assessed and reported to the Risk Committee
semi-annually.

## 5. Exit Planning

5.1 An exit strategy must be documented for all critical outsourcing
arrangements, including a maximum transition period of 120 business days.

5.2 Exit plans must identify alternative providers and the resources required
for a safe transition.

5.3 Exit plans must be tested at least every two years.

## 6. Register of Outsourcing Arrangements

6.1 The Bank must maintain a register of all outsourcing arrangements,
including: provider name, service description, criticality classification,
contract dates, and responsible owner.

6.2 The register must be updated within 10 business days of any new
arrangement or material change.

6.3 The register must be made available to regulators on request.

## 7. Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for the matters covered
by this document. The Chief Operating Officer is the designated executive
responsible for third-party risk management.

## 8. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a material
third-party failure. The review must be documented and signed off by the
policy owner.
