# Enhanced Whistleblower Protections

The Financial Conduct Authority has introduced enhanced protections for whistleblowers within regulated financial institutions. These measures strengthen the existing framework and impose new obligations on firms to foster a culture that encourages the reporting of wrongdoing.

## Anonymous Reporting Channels

All regulated firms must establish and maintain at least two independent channels for anonymous reporting of concerns. At least one channel must be operated by an external third party to ensure independence from the firm's management structure. Channels must be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

## Protection Against Retaliation

Firms must implement formal policies that prohibit any form of retaliation against employees who report concerns in good faith. Retaliation includes dismissal, demotion, reduction in compensation, reassignment, harassment, and any other adverse employment action.

Any allegation of retaliation must be investigated by a function independent of the respondent's management chain. Investigations must be completed within 30 days and outcomes communicated to both the reporter and the FCA.

## Whistleblower Champions

Each regulated firm must appoint a senior manager as the firm's Whistleblower Champion. This individual is responsible for ensuring that the firm's whistleblowing arrangements are effective, that reports are investigated appropriately, and that the board receives regular updates on whistleblowing activity.

## Training Requirements

All employees must receive whistleblowing awareness training within 30 days of joining the firm and annually thereafter. Training must cover how to report concerns, the protections available, and the firm's commitment to non-retaliation. Senior managers must receive additional training on their responsibilities for handling and investigating reports.

## FCA Reporting

Firms must report whistleblowing activity to the FCA annually, including the number of reports received, categories of concern, investigation outcomes, and any instances of alleged retaliation. Reports that indicate potential regulatory breaches must be escalated to the FCA within seven days.
