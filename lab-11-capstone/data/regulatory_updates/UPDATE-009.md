# New Operational Resilience Requirements

The Prudential Regulation Authority has published new requirements for operational resilience that apply to all PRA-regulated banks, building societies, and designated investment firms. These requirements establish a framework for identifying, testing, and maintaining the resilience of important business services.

## Important Business Services

Firms must identify their important business services by assessing which services, if disrupted, could cause harm to consumers, market integrity, or the firm's safety and soundness. Each important business service must have a documented owner at senior management level.

## Impact Tolerances

For each important business service, firms must set impact tolerances that define the maximum tolerable duration and extent of disruption. Impact tolerances must be expressed in measurable terms, such as maximum downtime in hours, maximum data loss in terms of recovery point objectives, and maximum number of affected customers.

## Scenario Testing

Firms must conduct scenario testing at least annually to assess their ability to remain within impact tolerances during severe but plausible disruption events. Scenarios must include technology failures, cyber attacks, third-party provider failures, and facility disruptions. Test results must be reported to the board within 30 days of completion.

## Third-Party Dependencies

Firms must map all third-party dependencies for each important business service. Where a single third-party provider supports multiple important business services, the firm must assess the concentration risk and develop contingency arrangements. Material outsourcing agreements must include clauses that support the firm's operational resilience objectives.

## Self-Assessment

Firms must submit an annual self-assessment to the PRA demonstrating their ability to remain within impact tolerances. The self-assessment must include details of testing conducted, vulnerabilities identified, and remediation actions taken or planned.

## Transition Period

Firms have until the effective date to complete their initial identification of important business services, set impact tolerances, and begin scenario testing. Full compliance, including demonstrated ability to remain within impact tolerances, is expected within two years of the effective date.
