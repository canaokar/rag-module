# New ESG Reporting Obligations for Financial Institutions

The European Banking Authority has introduced mandatory Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting obligations for all financial institutions operating within its supervisory scope. UK-regulated firms with EU operations or EU counterparty exposures must also comply.

## Disclosure Requirements

Firms must publish annual ESG disclosures covering their financed emissions across Scope 1, 2, and 3 categories. Scope 3 disclosures must include emissions associated with the firm's lending portfolio, investment holdings, and underwriting activities.

## Climate Risk Assessment

All firms must conduct and publish an annual climate risk assessment covering both physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks include the impact of climate events on collateral values and borrower viability. Transition risks include the impact of policy changes and technology shifts on portfolio exposures.

## Green Asset Ratio

Firms must calculate and disclose their Green Asset Ratio (GAR), defined as the proportion of assets that are aligned with the EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities. The initial reporting period allows firms to report the GAR for their banking book only, with the trading book to be included from 2026.

## Social and Governance Metrics

In addition to environmental disclosures, firms must report on social metrics including workforce diversity statistics, pay gap reporting, and community investment. Governance metrics must cover board composition, risk management frameworks, and whistleblower activity.

## Integration with Lending Decisions

Firms are expected to integrate ESG risk factors into their credit risk assessment frameworks. This includes incorporating climate scenario analysis into stress testing and adjusting risk weights for exposures with elevated ESG risk profiles. The EBA will publish technical standards for ESG risk weight adjustments by the end of 2025.
