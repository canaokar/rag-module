# Updated Outsourcing Risk Framework

The European Banking Authority has issued updated guidelines on outsourcing risk management for financial institutions. These guidelines apply to all outsourcing arrangements, with enhanced requirements for critical or important functions.

## Classification of Outsourced Functions

Firms must classify all outsourced functions as either critical/important or non-critical. A function is considered critical or important if a defect or failure in its performance would materially impair the firm's compliance with regulatory obligations, its financial performance, or the continuity of its business services.

## Risk Assessment

Prior to entering into any outsourcing arrangement for a critical or important function, firms must conduct a comprehensive risk assessment. The assessment must cover operational risk, concentration risk, data protection risk, business continuity risk, and reputational risk. The risk assessment must be approved by the firm's management body.

## Due Diligence

Firms must conduct thorough due diligence on prospective outsourcing providers, including assessment of their financial stability, technical capability, information security practices, and regulatory compliance track record. Due diligence must be refreshed at least annually for critical or important function providers.

## Contractual Requirements

Outsourcing agreements for critical or important functions must include specific clauses covering service level agreements with measurable targets, audit and access rights for the firm and its regulators, data protection obligations, sub-outsourcing restrictions, termination and exit provisions, and business continuity arrangements.

## Monitoring and Oversight

Firms must establish a dedicated outsourcing function or assign clear responsibility for ongoing monitoring of outsourcing arrangements. Monitoring must include regular performance reviews against agreed service levels, on-site inspections where appropriate, and independent audits of the provider's control environment.

## Register of Outsourced Functions

Firms must maintain a comprehensive register of all outsourcing arrangements. The register must be updated promptly when arrangements change and must be available to regulators on request. For critical or important functions, the register must include details of the risk assessment, due diligence findings, and monitoring outcomes.
