# Operational Risk Management Framework

## 1. Framework Overview

This framework establishes the Bank's approach to identifying, assessing,
monitoring, and mitigating operational risk. It aligns with Basel Committee
principles and PRA supervisory expectations.

Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or
failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events.

## 2. Risk Identification

2.1 All business units must maintain a Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA)
updated at least quarterly.

2.2 Loss events exceeding GBP 25,000 must be reported to the Operational Risk
function within 2 business days.

2.3 Near-miss events with a potential impact above GBP 50,000 must also be
recorded in the loss event database.

## 3. Key Risk Indicators

3.1 Each business unit must define and monitor at least 5 Key Risk Indicators
(KRIs) relevant to their operational profile.

3.2 KRI breaches must be escalated to the Head of Operational Risk within 2
business days and reported to the Risk Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

3.3 KRI thresholds must be calibrated annually to reflect changes in the
business environment and risk profile.

## 4. Scenario Analysis

4.1 Scenario analysis workshops must be conducted at least annually for each
material business unit.

4.2 Scenarios must cover both internal and external risk events, including
cyber attacks, technology failures, fraud, and regulatory sanctions.

4.3 Results of scenario analysis must feed into the capital adequacy assessment
and inform the setting of operational risk appetite.

## 5. Business Continuity

5.1 Critical business processes must have documented Business Continuity Plans
(BCPs) tested at least annually.

5.2 Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) for critical systems must not exceed 4
business days.

5.3 Disaster recovery tests must be conducted at least twice per year with
results reported to the Board Risk Committee.

## 6. Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for the matters covered
by this document. Day-to-day oversight is delegated to the Chief Risk Officer.

The Operational Risk Committee meets monthly to review the operational risk
profile, loss events, KRI performance, and emerging risks.

## 7. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a material
operational risk event. The review must be documented and signed off by the
Chief Risk Officer.

## 8. Definitions and Interpretation

"Operational Risk" means the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events (Basel
definition). This includes legal risk but excludes strategic and reputational
risk.

"Loss Event" means any event that results in a financial loss, regulatory
sanction, or operational disruption directly attributable to an operational
risk failure.

"Near Miss" means an event that could have resulted in a loss but was prevented
by chance or by the operation of existing controls.
