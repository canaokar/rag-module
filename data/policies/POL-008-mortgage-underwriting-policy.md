# Mortgage Underwriting Policy

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes the underwriting criteria and risk parameters for the
Bank's residential and buy-to-let mortgage products. It ensures compliance
with FCA MCOB rules and PRA supervisory expectations.

## 2. Eligibility Criteria

2.2 The maximum borrower age at the end of the mortgage term is 75 for
residential mortgages and 80 for buy-to-let mortgages.

2.3 First-time buyers must demonstrate a minimum deposit of 10% of the
property value. Existing homeowners must demonstrate a minimum deposit of 15%.

## 3. Affordability Assessment

3.1 Affordability must be assessed using the Bank's standard income
verification model, incorporating basic salary, regular overtime (where
evidenced over at least 12 months), and other verifiable income sources.

3.2 Expenditure must be assessed using the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) average expenditure data, adjusted for the applicant's household
composition and declared commitments.

3.3 The affordability stress test must apply an interest rate of the higher of
the product rate plus 3.0% or 7.0%, whichever is greater.

3.4 Debt-to-income ratio must not exceed 4.5x gross annual income for
residential mortgages, in line with the PRA's flow limit.

## 4. Loan-to-Value Limits

above 80% LTV).

4.2 Maximum LTV of 90% for residential remortgage.

4.3 Maximum LTV of 75% for buy-to-let mortgages.

4.4 Maximum LTV of 80% for new-build properties.

## 5. Valuation Requirements

5.1 All properties must be subject to a valuation by a surveyor on the Bank's
approved panel.

5.2 For loans above GBP 1,000,000, a full building survey (RICS Level 3) is
required.

5.3 Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) may be used for remortgage applications
with an LTV of 75% or below where the property type is standard residential.

## 6. Portfolio Limits

6.1 Aggregate exposure to buy-to-let mortgages must not exceed 20% of the
total mortgage book.

6.2 Exposure to interest-only mortgages must not exceed 15% of the total
mortgage book.

Committee member as specified in the Bank's Governance Map.
