# New Digital Identity Verification Standards

The Financial Conduct Authority has published new standards for digital identity verification, recognising the growing shift towards remote customer onboarding. These standards establish minimum requirements for technology-based identity verification methods.

## Approved Verification Methods

Firms may now use the following digital verification methods as primary identity checks, provided they meet the accuracy thresholds defined in this guidance:

Biometric verification using facial recognition technology must achieve a minimum accuracy rate of 99.5% as certified by an independent testing laboratory. Liveness detection must be incorporated to prevent spoofing using photographs or video recordings.

Document verification using optical character recognition (OCR) and document authenticity checks must be capable of detecting forged or altered identity documents with a minimum detection rate of 98%.

## Electronic Verification

Database-based electronic verification remains acceptable when cross-referencing at least two independent authoritative data sources. Firms must maintain records of which data sources were used for each verification.

## Ongoing Monitoring

Digital identity verification is not a one-time event. Firms must implement periodic re-verification for existing customers, with a frequency proportional to the customer risk rating. High-risk customers must be re-verified at least annually, standard-risk customers at least every three years.

## Record Keeping

All digital identity verification attempts, whether successful or unsuccessful, must be logged and retained for a minimum of five years. Logs must include the verification method used, the outcome, timestamp, and any error codes or failure reasons.

## Vendor Requirements

Third-party identity verification providers used by firms must be assessed annually against these standards. Firms remain responsible for the accuracy and reliability of verification outcomes regardless of whether the process is outsourced.
