# Anti-Money Laundering Policy

## 1. Purpose and Scope

1.1 This policy establishes the anti-money laundering (AML) framework for all business units operating within the United Kingdom. It applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party agents acting on behalf of the institution.

1.2 The purpose of this policy is to ensure compliance with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLR 2017), the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA), and the Terrorism Act 2000.

1.3 This policy covers the identification, assessment, monitoring, and reporting of money laundering and terrorist financing risks across all products, services, and delivery channels offered by the institution.

1.4 All business units must implement adequate systems and controls proportionate to the nature, scale, and complexity of their activities. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, regulatory sanctions, or criminal prosecution.

## 2. Customer Due Diligence

2.1 Standard Customer Due Diligence (CDD) must be performed on all new customers prior to establishing a business relationship. CDD requirements include verification of the customer's identity using reliable and independent sources.

2.2 The following identity documents are acceptable for individual customers: a valid passport, a UK driving licence, or a national identity card issued by an EEA member state. At least one document must include a photograph.

2.3 For corporate customers, CDD must include verification of the company's legal existence through Companies House records, identification of the beneficial ownership structure, and verification of the identity of all individuals holding more than 25 percent of the shares or voting rights.

2.4 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) must be applied in the following circumstances: the customer is a Politically Exposed Person (PEP), the business relationship involves a high-risk third country as identified by the European Commission, the transaction is unusually complex or large with no apparent economic purpose, or the customer has been flagged by internal risk scoring models.

2.5 Simplified Due Diligence (SDD) may be applied only where the institution has determined that the business relationship or transaction presents a low risk of money laundering. SDD is not permitted for any relationship involving a PEP or a high-risk third country.

2.6 Customer identity must be re-verified at intervals not exceeding 36 months for standard-risk customers, 12 months for high-risk customers, and 6 months for PEPs. Any material change in the customer's circumstances must trigger an immediate review.

## 3. Transaction Monitoring

3.1 All customer transactions must be subject to automated monitoring using the institution's designated transaction monitoring system. The system must be configured to detect patterns indicative of money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions evasion.

3.2 The following transaction thresholds require mandatory review: single cash transactions of 10,000 GBP or more, aggregate cash transactions exceeding 10,000 GBP within a rolling 30-day period, wire transfers to or from jurisdictions on the institution's high-risk country list, and any transaction that deviates significantly from the customer's established profile.

3.3 Alert investigation must be completed within 5 business days of generation. Investigators must document their findings, the rationale for their decision, and any escalation actions taken. Alerts that cannot be resolved within the standard timeframe must be escalated to the Financial Crime Investigations team.

3.4 The transaction monitoring system parameters must be reviewed and recalibrated at least quarterly to ensure that detection scenarios remain effective. The compliance team must provide evidence of model tuning and false positive rate analysis at each review cycle.

3.5 Structured transactions designed to avoid reporting thresholds (commonly known as "structuring" or "smurfing") must be identified and reported. Staff must be trained to recognise patterns of structured deposits, withdrawals, or transfers that aggregate near the reporting threshold.

## 4. Suspicious Activity Reporting

4.1 Any employee who knows or suspects that a person is engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing must submit an internal Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) without delay.

4.2 The MLRO must evaluate all internal SARs and, where appropriate, file a Suspicious Activity Report with the National Crime Agency (NCA) via the SAR Online portal. Filing must occur as soon as practicable and no later than 3 business days after the MLRO determines that a disclosure is warranted.

4.3 Under no circumstances may any employee disclose to the customer or any third party that a SAR has been filed or that an investigation is underway. Tipping off is a criminal offence under Section 333A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, punishable by up to 2 years imprisonment.

4.4 The institution must maintain a complete and auditable record of all internal SARs, NCA filings, and the decision-making rationale for each case. These records must be retained for a minimum of 5 years from the date the business relationship ends.

4.5 Consent requests submitted to the NCA under the Defence Against Money Laundering (DAML) regime must be tracked separately. If the NCA does not respond within 7 working days, the institution receives deemed consent and may proceed with the transaction, subject to ongoing monitoring.

## 5. Record Keeping

5.1 All CDD records, including copies of identification documents and verification evidence, must be retained for a minimum of 5 years from the date the business relationship with the customer ends, or 5 years from the date of the last transaction, whichever is later.

5.2 Transaction records must include sufficient detail to reconstruct each transaction. Required fields include: date and time, amount and currency, counterparty details, originating and receiving account numbers, and the purpose of the transaction where known.

5.3 Records must be stored in a manner that permits timely retrieval in response to requests from the FCA, NCA, HM Revenue and Customs, or any other competent authority. The maximum response time for regulatory data requests is 5 business days.

5.4 Electronic records must be backed up in accordance with the institution's data retention and disaster recovery policies. Physical records must be stored in secure, access-controlled facilities with appropriate fire and water protection.

5.5 When the retention period expires, records must be destroyed securely using methods appropriate to their classification. Destruction must be documented in the records management log with the date, method, and authorising officer.

## 6. Training Requirements

6.1 All employees must complete AML awareness training within 30 days of joining the institution. This training must cover the legal framework, the institution's policies and procedures, and the employee's personal obligations under POCA and the MLR 2017.

6.2 Role-specific training must be provided to employees in customer-facing roles, compliance functions, and senior management. This training must address the specific money laundering risks associated with the employee's role and the products or services they manage.

6.3 Refresher training must be completed annually by all employees. The training content must be updated to reflect changes in legislation, regulatory guidance, emerging typologies, and lessons learned from internal or external cases.

6.4 Training completion rates must be tracked and reported to the Board Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. A completion rate below 95 percent for any business unit must trigger a remediation plan within 30 days.

6.5 The effectiveness of the training programme must be assessed through post-training assessments, with a minimum pass rate of 80 percent. Employees who fail the assessment must retake the training within 14 days and pass on the second attempt. Repeated failure must be escalated to the employee's line manager and Human Resources.
