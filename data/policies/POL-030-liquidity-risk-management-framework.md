# Liquidity Risk Management Framework

## 1. Framework Overview

This framework establishes the Bank's approach to liquidity risk management
in compliance with CRR II Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable
Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirements. It aligns with PRA SS24/15 and Basel
Committee principles for sound liquidity risk management.

## 2. Liquidity Risk Appetite

2.1 The Bank defines liquidity risk appetite as the level and type of
liquidity risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its strategic
objectives.

2.2 Key liquidity risk appetite metrics:

- Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): minimum 100%, internal target 120%
- Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): minimum 100%, internal target 110%
- Survival horizon under combined stress: minimum 90 days
- Loan-to-deposit ratio: maximum 100%

## 3. Liquidity Buffers

3.1 The Bank must maintain an LCR of at least 100% at all times, with an
internal target of 120%.

3.2 High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) must comprise at least 70% Level 1
assets (cash, central bank reserves, qualifying government bonds).

3.3 The composition of the liquidity buffer must be diversified by asset
type, currency, and counterparty.

## 4. Funding Management

4.1 The Bank must maintain a diversified funding base to avoid excessive
concentration in any single funding source.

4.2 Wholesale funding with a maturity of less than 30 days must not exceed
20% of total funding.

4.3 The Bank must maintain access to at least three independent wholesale
funding channels.

4.4 Encumbered assets must not exceed 30% of total assets.

## 5. Stress Testing

5.1 Liquidity stress tests must be conducted monthly under idiosyncratic,
market-wide, and combined scenarios.

5.2 The survival horizon under the combined stress scenario must exceed 60
business days.

5.3 Stress test assumptions must include: deposit outflows, collateral
calls, drawdown of committed facilities, loss of wholesale funding, and
increased haircuts on HQLA.

5.4 Stress test results must be reported to ALCO within 5 business days
of completion.

## 6. Intraday Liquidity Management

6.1 The Bank must monitor intraday liquidity positions in real time across
all major currencies and payment systems.

6.2 Intraday liquidity buffers must be sufficient to meet peak payment
obligations under normal and stressed conditions.

6.3 Intraday liquidity metrics must be reported to the PRA in accordance
with the Basel BCBS 248 framework.

## 7. Contingency Funding Plan

7.1 The Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) must be reviewed and approved by ALCO
at least annually and tested at least semi-annually.

7.2 The CFP must identify: early warning indicators, escalation triggers,
available contingency funding sources, communication protocols, and
responsibilities.

7.3 Contingency funding sources must be tested periodically to ensure they
remain accessible. This includes testing the Bank's ability to access the
Bank of England's Sterling Monetary Framework facilities.

## 8. Transfer Pricing

8.1 The Bank operates a Funds Transfer Pricing (FTP) framework that charges
business units for liquidity consumed and credits them for liquidity
generated.

8.2 FTP rates must be reviewed at least quarterly to reflect market
conditions and the Bank's cost of funding.

## 9. Governance and Oversight

The Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) meets monthly and is responsible
for overseeing the Bank's liquidity risk profile. ALCO is chaired by the
Chief Financial Officer and reports to the Board Risk Committee.

The Treasury function is responsible for day-to-day liquidity management
and for maintaining the liquidity buffer.

## 10. Review and Amendment

This framework must be reviewed at least annually or following a material
change in liquidity conditions or regulatory requirements. The review must
be documented and signed off by the Chief Financial Officer and approved by
the Board Risk Committee.

## 11. Related Documents

This framework should be read in conjunction with the Capital Adequacy
Policy, the Risk Appetite Statement, the Recovery Plan, and the ILAAP
document.
