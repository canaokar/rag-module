This procedure establishes the process for identifying, escalating, and
resolving compliance breaches and regulatory obligations. It supports the
Bank's Compliance Policy and applies to all business areas.

## 2. Regulatory Horizon Scanning

2.1 The Compliance team must conduct horizon scanning at least monthly to
identify new or amended regulatory requirements applicable to the Bank.

2.2 Identified changes must be assessed for impact within 15 business days
and assigned to a responsible owner.

2.3 Sources for horizon scanning include: FCA and PRA publications, EBA
guidelines, Basel Committee standards, industry consultations, and legal
advisories.

## 3. Compliance Monitoring Programme

3.1 An annual Compliance Monitoring Programme must be approved by the Board
Audit Committee and cover all material regulatory obligations.

3.2 Monitoring reviews must be risk-based, with high-risk areas reviewed at
least quarterly and medium-risk areas reviewed semi-annually.

3.3 Each monitoring review must produce a formal report documenting: scope,
methodology, findings, risk ratings, and recommended actions.

3.4 All findings rated as High or Critical must have agreed remediation actions
with deadlines not exceeding 30 business days.

## 4. Breach Reporting

Compliance Incident Management System within 2 business days of discovery.

4.2 Material breaches with a financial impact exceeding GBP 250,000 or

4.3 Root cause analysis must be completed within 20 business days and

4.4 The Compliance function must determine whether a breach requires
notification to the FCA or PRA and, if so, submit the notification within
the required timeframe.

## 5. Regulatory Reporting

5.1 All regulatory returns must be submitted by the deadline specified by the
relevant regulator. A schedule of reporting obligations must be maintained by
the Compliance team.

5.2 Draft returns must be reviewed by a second qualified individual before
submission. Any errors identified post-submission must be corrected and
resubmitted within 5 business days.

5.3 The Compliance team must maintain a log of all regulatory interactions,
including supervisory visits, information requests, and skilled person
reviews.

## 6. Compliance Risk Assessment

6.1 A Compliance Risk Assessment must be completed annually, covering all
regulatory obligations and identifying areas of elevated risk.

6.2 The assessment must consider: regulatory change, business change,
historical compliance performance, industry trends, and enforcement activity.

## 7. Governance and Oversight

The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for the Compliance Monitoring
Programme. The Board Audit Committee receives quarterly reports on compliance
status, breach activity, and regulatory developments.

## 8. Review and Amendment

This procedure must be reviewed at least annually or following a material
regulatory change or compliance failure.
