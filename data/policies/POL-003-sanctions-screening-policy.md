Committee quarterly. The target false positive rate is below 3.5%.

## 4. Designated Persons and Entities

4.1 The Bank maintains a consolidated internal watchlist that incorporates entries

List, and the OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List.

4.2 The watchlist must be updated within 24 hours of any amendment published by
the relevant authority.

achieve a detection rate of at least 99.5% while maintaining operationally
manageable false positive volumes.

## 5. Frozen Assets and Restricted Transactions

be frozen immediately, pending further instruction from the relevant authority.

by OFSI or the equivalent competent authority.

5.3 The total value of frozen assets must be reported to OFSI within 7 business
days of the freeze being implemented.
