The Bank targets a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of at least 12.5%.

  other reserves, less regulatory deductions

  features at the point of non-viability

at least annually and approved by the Board.

3.2 Stress testing must be conducted under at least three scenarios: baseline,
adverse, and severely adverse.

3.3 Capital buffers must be maintained above regulatory minimums by at least
2.0% to absorb unexpected losses.

3.4 The capital plan must cover a forward-looking period of at least 3 years
and incorporate projected business growth, dividend policy, and potential
losses.

## 4. Capital Allocation

measurement using the Bank's internal economic capital model.

4.2 New product launches with estimated RWA impact exceeding GBP 3,000,000

5.2 Where capital buffers are utilised, a capital restoration plan must be
submitted to the PRA within 5 business days.

## 6. Dividend and Distribution Policy

6.1 Dividends may only be paid where the Bank's capital position is above
all regulatory minimum requirements including buffers.

6.2 The Board must approve all dividend payments, taking into account the
capital plan, stress test results, and the PRA's expectations.

Part Eight requirements.

7.2 Disclosures include: capital composition, risk-weighted assets by risk
type, leverage ratio, and liquidity coverage ratio.

the ICAAP. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for day-to-day capital
management. The Capital Committee meets monthly to review capital metrics and
forecasts.
