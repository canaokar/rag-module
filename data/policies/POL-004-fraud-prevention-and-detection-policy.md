# Fraud Prevention and Detection Policy

## 1. Scope

This policy covers the prevention, detection, investigation, and reporting
of fraud, including internal fraud, external fraud, cyber fraud, and
authorised push payment (APP) fraud.

## 2. Prevention Controls

2.1 Multi-factor authentication must be enforced for all customer-facing
digital channels.

2.2 Transactions exceeding GBP 5,000 via online banking must trigger a
step-up authentication challenge.

2.3 Employee access to payment systems must follow the principle of least
privilege and be recertified every 75 business days.

## 3. Investigation and Recovery

3.1 All suspected fraud cases must be referred to the Financial Crime
Investigations Unit within 2 business days of detection.

3.2 Recovery actions must commence within 3 business days of confirming fraud,
including freezing of accounts and notification to law enforcement.

## 4. APP Fraud Protections

4.1 The Bank must implement Confirmation of Payee (CoP) checks for all
outbound Faster Payments and CHAPS transfers.

4.2 Where a CoP check returns a partial or no match, the customer must be
presented with a clear warning before proceeding.

4.3 Reimbursement of APP fraud victims must follow the contingent reimbursement
model code, with decisions made within 15 business days of the claim being
raised.

## 5. Internal Fraud Controls

5.1 Segregation of duties must be enforced for all payment initiation and
approval processes. No single individual may both create and authorise a
payment.

5.2 Unusual employee behaviour, including access outside normal working hours
or repeated override of system controls, must be flagged by the monitoring
system and reviewed within 5 business days.

## 6. Reporting and Metrics

6.1 Monthly fraud loss reports must be submitted to the Financial Crime
Committee, broken down by fraud type, channel, and business unit.

6.2 The Bank targets a fraud loss ratio below 0.02% of total transaction value.
Breaches of this threshold must be escalated to the Chief Risk Officer.

## 7. Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for the matters covered
by this document. Day-to-day oversight is delegated to the relevant Executive
Committee member as specified in the Bank's Governance Map.

The policy owner must present a summary of compliance status, key metrics, and
emerging risks to the relevant Board sub-committee at least semi-annually.

Any material exceptions to this policy must be approved by the relevant
Executive Committee member and recorded in the policy exception register.
Exceptions are valid for a maximum period of 12 months and must be reviewed
before renewal.

## 8. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a material change
in regulation, business strategy, or risk profile. The review must be documented
and signed off by the policy owner.

Amendments must follow the Bank's Document Change Control Procedure. All staff
affected by changes must be notified within 10 business days and must acknowledge
receipt.

## 9. Related Documents

This document should be read in conjunction with the Bank's Risk Appetite
Statement, the Group Compliance Policy, the Conduct Risk Framework, and any
relevant regulatory guidance published by the FCA, PRA, or EBA.

Where there is a conflict between this document and any applicable law or
regulation, the law or regulation takes precedence. Any such conflict must be
reported to the Compliance function for resolution.
