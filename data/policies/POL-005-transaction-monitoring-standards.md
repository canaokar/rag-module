# Transaction Monitoring Standards

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This standard defines the requirements for automated and manual transaction
monitoring across all business lines. It supports the Bank's AML Policy and
ensures compliance with the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG)
guidance.

## 2. Monitoring Thresholds

2.1 All transactions above GBP 10,000 must be screened against internal
watchlists and the HM Treasury consolidated sanctions list within 1 business
day of execution.

2.2 The automated monitoring system shall flag transactions that deviate by
more than 30.0% from the customer's established behavioural profile.

2.3 Cash transactions at or above GBP 15,000 (or the foreign currency
equivalent) must trigger an automatic enhanced review.

## 3. Scenario-Based Monitoring

3.1 The monitoring system must incorporate at least the following scenarios:
structuring and smurfing detection, rapid movement of funds, unusual geographic
patterns, dormant account activation, and round-amount transfers.

3.2 Scenario thresholds must be calibrated at least semi-annually based on
typology reviews and regulatory guidance.

3.3 New scenarios must be developed and deployed within 45 business days of
identification of a new money laundering typology.

## 4. Alert Management

4.1 All system-generated alerts must be triaged within 2 business days. High-
priority alerts must be triaged within 1 business day.

4.2 Alerts that cannot be cleared through initial triage must be escalated to
a Level 2 analyst for detailed investigation within 5 business days.

4.3 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) must be filed with the National Crime
Agency within 3 business days of the investigation concluding that suspicion
is established. The MLRO must approve all SARs before submission.

## 5. System Governance

5.1 The transaction monitoring system must be subject to an independent model
validation at least annually.

5.2 System performance metrics, including alert volumes, false positive rates,
and SAR conversion rates, must be reported to the Financial Crime Committee
monthly.

5.3 Any changes to monitoring rules or thresholds must be approved by the Head
of Financial Crime and documented in the change log.

## 6. Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for the matters covered
by this document. Day-to-day oversight is delegated to the relevant Executive
Committee member as specified in the Bank's Governance Map.

The policy owner must present a summary of compliance status, key metrics, and
emerging risks to the relevant Board sub-committee at least semi-annually.

## 7. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a material change
in regulation, business strategy, or risk profile. The review must be documented
and signed off by the policy owner.

Amendments must follow the Bank's Document Change Control Procedure. All staff
affected by changes must be notified within 14 business days and must acknowledge
receipt.
