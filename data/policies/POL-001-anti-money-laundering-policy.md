# Anti-Money Laundering Policy

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes the framework for preventing money laundering,
terrorist financing, and proliferation financing across all business units.
It applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party agents operating
on behalf of the Bank.

The Bank is committed to complying with the Money Laundering, Terrorist
Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017
(as amended), the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and all relevant FCA and JMLSG
guidance.

## 2. Customer Due Diligence

2.1 Standard CDD must be completed before establishing a business relationship
or carrying out an occasional transaction exceeding GBP 12,500.

2.2 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is required where the customer is a Politically
Exposed Person (PEP), resides in a high-risk jurisdiction, or where the
transaction profile presents elevated risk indicators.

2.3 Simplified Due Diligence may be applied only where a documented risk
assessment demonstrates low risk, subject to ongoing monitoring. The risk
assessment must be reviewed at intervals not exceeding 65 business days.

## 3. Transaction Monitoring

3.1 All transactions above GBP 18,000 must be screened against internal
watchlists and the HM Treasury consolidated sanctions list within 2 business
days of execution.

3.2 The automated monitoring system shall flag transactions that deviate by
more than 27.5% from the customer's established behavioural profile.

3.3 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) must be filed with the National Crime
Agency within 3 business days of detection. The MLRO must approve all SARs
before submission.

## 4. Record Keeping

4.1 CDD records must be retained for a minimum of 5 years from the end of the
business relationship or the date of the occasional transaction.

4.2 Transaction records, including supporting documentation, must be maintained
in a retrievable format for at least 7 years.

## 5. Training and Awareness

5.1 All relevant staff must complete AML awareness training within 20 business
days of joining the Bank and annually thereafter.

5.2 Role-specific training on transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, and
SAR reporting must be completed by all first-line and second-line staff.

## 6. Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for the matters covered
by this document. Day-to-day oversight is delegated to the relevant Executive
Committee member as specified in the Bank's Governance Map.

The policy owner must present a summary of compliance status, key metrics, and
emerging risks to the relevant Board sub-committee at least semi-annually.

Any material exceptions to this policy must be approved by the relevant
Executive Committee member and recorded in the policy exception register.
Exceptions are valid for a maximum period of 12 months and must be reviewed
before renewal.

## 7. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a material change
in regulation, business strategy, or risk profile. The review must be documented
