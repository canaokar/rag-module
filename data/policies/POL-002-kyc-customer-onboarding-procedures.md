# KYC Customer Onboarding Procedures

## 1. Introduction

This procedure details the operational steps for conducting Know Your Customer
(KYC) checks in accordance with the Bank's AML Policy. All customer-facing
teams must follow these procedures without exception.

## 2. Identity Verification

2.1 For natural persons, identity must be verified using at least one
government-issued photo identification document (passport, national identity
card, or driving licence) and one proof of address dated within the last
75 business days.

2.2 For corporate entities, the following must be obtained: certificate of
incorporation, memorandum and articles of association, register of directors
and shareholders, and evidence of registered address.

2.3 Beneficial owners holding 15.0% or more of the entity must be identified
and verified to the same standard as natural persons.

## 3. Risk Classification

3.1 Each customer must be assigned a risk rating of Low, Medium, or High based
on the Bank's Customer Risk Assessment Matrix (CRAM).

3.2 Factors influencing the risk rating include: country of residence, nature of
business, expected transaction volume, source of funds, and PEP status.

3.3 High-risk customers require approval from the Head of Compliance before
onboarding and must be reviewed every 120 business days.

## 4. Ongoing Monitoring

4.1 Customer profiles must be reviewed at intervals determined by their risk
classification: Low -- every 36 months; Medium -- every 12 months; High -- every
6 months.

4.2 Any material change in the customer's circumstances triggers an immediate
review and potential re-classification.

## 5. Documentation Requirements

5.1 All KYC documentation must be uploaded to the central Customer Information
File (CIF) within 5 business days of receipt.

5.2 Where documents are obtained in a language other than English, a certified
translation must be obtained and stored alongside the original.

5.3 Digital copies must meet the Bank's minimum image quality standards as set
out in the Digital Records Policy (minimum 300 DPI, full colour).

## 6. Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for the matters covered
by this document. Day-to-day oversight is delegated to the relevant Executive
Committee member as specified in the Bank's Governance Map.

The policy owner must present a summary of compliance status, key metrics, and
emerging risks to the relevant Board sub-committee at least semi-annually.

Any material exceptions to this policy must be approved by the relevant
Executive Committee member and recorded in the policy exception register.
Exceptions are valid for a maximum period of 12 months and must be reviewed
before renewal.

## 7. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a material change
in regulation, business strategy, or risk profile. The review must be documented
and signed off by the policy owner.

Amendments must follow the Bank's Document Change Control Procedure. All staff
affected by changes must be notified within 12 business days and must acknowledge
receipt.

Previous versions of this document must be retained in the Bank's policy
