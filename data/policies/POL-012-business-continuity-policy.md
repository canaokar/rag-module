# Business Continuity Policy

## 1. Framework Overview

This policy establishes the Bank's approach to ensuring continuity of critical
business operations during disruptive events. It aligns with PRA operational
resilience expectations and the Bank's Important Business Services mapping.

## 2. Important Business Services

2.1 The Bank has identified the following Important Business Services (IBS)
in accordance with PRA SS1/21: payments processing, deposit taking, lending
origination, treasury operations, and customer service channels.

2.2 Each IBS must have a documented impact tolerance specifying the maximum
tolerable disruption period and the maximum acceptable data loss.

2.3 Impact tolerances must be approved by the Board and tested at least
annually.

## 3. Business Continuity Plans

3.1 Each business unit must maintain a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) that
covers: activation criteria, communication protocols, recovery procedures,
resource requirements, and dependencies on third parties.

3.2 BCPs must be tested at least annually through desktop exercises, and at
least every two years through full simulation exercises.

3.3 BCP testing results must be reported to the Operational Risk Committee
within 15 business days of the test completion.

## 4. Crisis Management

4.1 The Crisis Management Team (CMT) is responsible for coordinating the
Bank's response to major disruptions. The CMT is chaired by the Chief
Operating Officer.

4.2 The CMT must be activated within 1 hour of a major disruption being
declared.

4.3 Communication to staff, customers, regulators, and the media must follow
the pre-approved crisis communication templates.

## 5. Recovery Time and Point Objectives

5.1 Recovery Time Objectives for critical systems:

- Core banking platform: 4 hours
- Payments processing: 2 hours
- Online and mobile banking: 8 hours
- Internal communications: 4 hours
- Regulatory reporting systems: 24 hours

5.2 Recovery Point Objectives (maximum acceptable data loss):

- Transactional data: zero data loss (synchronous replication)
- Customer records: maximum 1 hour
- Management information: maximum 24 hours

## 6. Third-Party Dependencies

6.1 All critical third-party dependencies must be documented in the BCP,
including alternative providers where available.

6.2 Third parties supporting Important Business Services must demonstrate
equivalent resilience capabilities and participate in testing at least
annually.

## 7. Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors retains ultimate responsibility for operational
resilience. The Chief Operating Officer is the designated executive
responsible for business continuity.

## 8. Review and Amendment

This document must be reviewed at least annually or following a major
disruptive event. Lessons learned from any activation must be incorporated
within 30 business days.
